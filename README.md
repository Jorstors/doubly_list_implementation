# doubly_list_program
A program that takes user input via an indefinite menu and manipulates a doubly linked list based on what the user decides.
Within the header file, a struct type is announced named Node. These "Nodes" store a single piece of data, and two seperate Node pointers, pointing forwards and backwards to other nodes so that they all may _link_ together.
A class is made, named doublyLinkedList, in which object methods including inserting data, and releasing data from both the front and back, are written.
In the Implementation file, the menu function is created
The main file calls for the menu to be ran until called to exit by the user
